TPG Mobile Usage Helper
=======================

A crude greasemonkey script for improving the TPG mobile usage page. It was written for a PAYG account type which is no longer available, but could probably be adapated to work on most accounts without much trouble.

Adds a running total of data usage and excess charge; and also highlights more expensive line items.
